## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Charades:

- setting time for a round

App Ideas:

Karades:
This app is basically charades but make it karoake! There are two ways to play this 
game. The first is called group play. The app plays a song and the players try to 
guess the song before time runs out! The second way is called group vs. group (2+   
people). One group/person acts out the song while its playing (they can see the  
name) and the other side guesses the song. There are a variety of decks to choose 
from like pop songs, the 2000's, rap, etc. 

K-App:
A language learning app that allows users to learn Korean in a game format. Three main pages: lessons, practice, and review. Users read through/ watch videos in the lessons section then do practice problems. Practice problems can be multiple choice, fill in the blank, or even voice-to-text. Earn points as you go along (similar to Duolingo points). The review page is like a TikTok page with short videos for reviewing concepts from lessons. You can save things you have a hard time with and like things that you already understand. 


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

There weren't any challenges building the app itself but it took me some time learning how to use Xcode.
